Title: Fits an empirical Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain
        posterior probabilities that each gene is a driver.
Description: The model accounts for (1) frequency of mutation compared to a
    sophisticated background model that accounts for gene-specific factors in
    addition to mutation type and nucleotide context, (2) predicted
    functional impact (in the form of SIFT scores) of each specific change,
    and (3) oncogenic patterns in the position of mutations that have been
    deposited into the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer)
    database.
